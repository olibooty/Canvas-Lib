# Canvas Lib

## About
This project is build with vanilla javascript, using classes to encapsulate logic for a canvas library.

I have then used this library to create a basic game as an example.

I have also used this as an experiment with emitting js modules with the typescript compiler.

A complete version of the 2-player pong game is in the root of the project.
